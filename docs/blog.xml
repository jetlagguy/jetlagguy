&lt;h1 id="jet-lag-and-the-logies"&gt;Jet Lag and the Logies&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="../../images/blueclock.png" style="width:3mm;height:3mm" /&gt;
On the weekend there was the Logies, after a three year absence due to
you-know-what, the virus that I refuse to mention out loud. The virus
whose name I dare not speak in case I summon it again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, at the Logies there was a performance by Calum Scott, who had
flown out from the UK just before the Logies. And he delivered a
brilliant performance at the Logies, considering how jetlagged he would
have been, but in his own words he was “in the sky longer than he was on
the ground”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performing brilliantly, despite jet lag!&lt;br /&gt;
And that, folks, is a recipe for jet lag. Just ask Pamela Anderson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a really short business trip like this – and for Calum Scott,
this is a business trip – you wouldn’t bother adjusting your schedule
(Gordon et al. 2018). So no after parties for him, he’ll definitely be
ready for bed after performing. Pilots and cabin crew do exactly this,
which is why the cabin crew often ask you to shut your blinds while
flying – it’s not for your benefit, it’s for theirs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we’re flying a bit more, it’s likely that people will be
doing short flights for long distances – like London for three days. If
you do a short trip for a few days, it’s probably worth staying in your
own time zone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay safe and happy (and safe!) travels&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Steve, the Jet Lag Guy&lt;/p&gt;
